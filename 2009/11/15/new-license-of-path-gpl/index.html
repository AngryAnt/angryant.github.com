<p>Since I started at Unity, I haven&#8217;t really had the time to do much updating (read: none) of my private projects. In sheer size, Path is the largest of those, so a while ago I realised that maintaining that project is simply not feasible.</p>
<p>By adding the <span class="caps">GPL</span> license option to the existing two license options (the show-my-logo license displayed on <a href="/path/downloads/">download from angryant.com</a> and the option for a custom negotiated one), users are able to test and modify the source of Path directly &#8211; before deciding on one of the other licenses.</p>
<p>Also, although very messy (yes &#8211; very), the source could also serve as a good learning resource for Unity editor scripting.</p>
<p>The project repository is available on <a href="http://github.com/AngryAnt/Path-GPL">github</a> .</p>
