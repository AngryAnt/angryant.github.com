<p>After lots of late night tinkering, Behave 1.0 is finally out. This version fixes all known issues with unity 2.5, brings in lessons learned from Path 1.0 meaning a smashing new interface plus lots of new additions.</p>
<p>The new tree editor contains interface improvements allowing for much faster tree building: A brand new component bar, sub-tree movement, integration with the standard unity inspector and more.</p>
<p>In this version, the Behave runtime have also received an update. More runtime data is more easily available from the tree and library classes and methods implemented in your agent scripts are now mapped directly (by name) to action and decorator invokes.</p>
<p>This site will be updated as soon as possible with all the changes and additions and the documentation will be brought up to speed.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the downloads section and get your copy today!</p>
