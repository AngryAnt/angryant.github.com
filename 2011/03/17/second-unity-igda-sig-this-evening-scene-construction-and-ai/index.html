<p>A week has passed and the second of six Unity specific <span class="caps">IGDA</span> SIGs is upon us. Like last time, the event will take place at the IT University, Copenhagen, Denmark at 1800.</p>
<p>We will meet in the reception and from there move to the auditorium. The originally planned physics bit of todays <span class="caps">SIG</span> has been rescheduled to next thursday, where Jonas Echterhoff will be in town and give the talk. Jonas is the man with the plan of the PhysX integration in Unity, so added awesomenessness!</p>
<p>This means that today Joe Robins will be talking about scene construction and I will be covering AI in Unity.</p>
<p>For this thursday we should be lucky and get even more Unity Tech people to participate in the discussion bit of the <span class="caps">SIG</span>. And remember afterwards we&#8217;re doing the bar meet and given it&#8217;s Saint Patricks, we&#8217;re likely to be a good group of people moving from bar to bar.</p>
