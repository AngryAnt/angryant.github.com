					<div class="post"><p>A little over a month ago <a href="http://angryant.com/2013/08/25/Behave-2-0/">I shipped Behave 2</a> after having spent quite a while rewiring a lot of the core of the project. Today you get to see even more benefit of this work as already I am ready with version 2.1.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the AngryAnt community who have been a great help in identifying bugs I had not found and properly corner those I had.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p><img src="/resources/posts/2013-10-06-Behave-2-1/Parameter.png" alt="" />
While the full changelist will follow the body of this post as per usual, I would still like to draw out a few of the main changes in 2.1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Auto complete on contexts, action names and string parameters makes for faster editing and helps guard against typos.</li>
	<li>Partial library export and import-to-library makes moving trees between projects a breeze.</li>
	<li>Parameterised trees increase tree re-usability even more by exposing select node settings as tree parameters, tweak-able per reference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Onwards</h2>
<p>While 2.1 brings great additions to the solid feature set of Behave 2, I am far from done.</p>
<p>I realise that many currently still on the fence with regards to upgrading from 1.x have asked for more in terms of examples and demos and I will do my best to get to that as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As always, I greatly appreciate any feedback you might have.</p>

Changelist:

2.1:
 - Added autocomplete on action names, string parameters and component contexts.
 - Added mandatory actions (present in library regardless of use in trees).
 - Added partial library export and library merging / import-to-library.
 - Added Behave stripping - leave behind only a very lean Behave runtime, for redistribution or super slim deploy.
 - Added parameterised trees - get even more re-use out of your trees by overriding context and variables per reference.
 - Behavioural change: Tree.Reset will now delay resetting tree variables until after complete component reset.
 - Behavioural change: Tree.Tick will no longer automatically reset the tree upon completion. This plays very well with:
 - Added Tree.TickContinuously (int iterationCap = 1024) - ticks tree till completion or iteration cap is reached.
 - Added BehaveResult Tree.Result (bool value) utility function to side with Tree.Invert (BehaveResult value).
 - Added int Debugging.Local.ConnectionCount property - facilitating debug behaviour dependent on Behave debugger presence.
 - Moved default install path from Assets/Behave to Assets/Plugins/Behave.
    - WARNING: See Readme.txt upgrade guide.
 - Fixed decorator control node removal resulting in detached control connection.
 - Fixed decorator incorrectly not forwarding the instant status of its child node.
 - Fixed scenario where agent classes would get reflected for handlers even if blueprint derived.
 - Fixed unexpected corner cases of bad library configuration failing compiles (now causing warnings or simply being ignored).
 - Fixed Behave window breaking down when exiting play mode after having been active there.
 - Fixes to context getting incorrectly reset in some scenarios.
 - Fixed copy / paste functionality missing in some text fields.
 - Lots of UI polish and minor fixes.


2.0:
 - New editor.
    - Unified all controls into one window.
    - Completely customised look - compatible with both Unity light and dark skin.
    - Keyboard authoring interface in addition to drag &amp; drop.
 - Debugger upgrade.
    - Remote debugging.
    - Tick and reset.
    - "Unplug" for debugger-only control.
    - Breakpoints.
    - Action overrides - override the return values of specified actions.
 - Decorator rewrite.
    - Deprecated old decorator.
       - Still compiles, but cannot be added.
    - Decorators are now control-type components.
       - No specific decorator handlers on agents.
       - Control is achieved via third connection socket.
    - Two initial decorator types: Repeater and Interrupter.
 - Asset restructuring.
 	- No more collections - for nesting, use paths in tree names.
 	- New serialization format - see Readme.txt for upgrade instructions.
    - Collections are gone. Use Unix-style path names for tree organisation.
 - IAgent.Tick (Tree, bool) changed to IAgent.Tick (Tree)
	- Init calls can now only be handled explicitly
 - Full coverage online documentation and other community resources.
 - Countless fixes and polish items.

1.5:
 - Added Tree.TickActive - indicating if a tree is currently executing a tick or if it has completed evaluation.
 - In-tick tree reset requests now result in a reset at the end of tree evaluation rather than an immediate one.
 - Removed the legacy compatibility assembly (for compatibility with pre-1.2 assets) from the default distribution.
 - Fixed "X must be instantiated using the ScriptableObject.CreateInstance method instead of new X" warnings.

1.4:
 - Fixed decorator incorrectly initializing on every returning tick when tick handler returned Running.
 - Fixed debugger view dependency on active tree editor - causing reported null reference exception.
 - Fixed missing scrollbars on browser window.
 - Reduced logging noise from debug builds.
 - Agent blueprints can now be MonoBehaviour based.
 - Clarified wording on "library not loaded".
 - Now handling reset a bit cleverer - potential performance boost.
 - Changed the default success criteria of Parallel components from SuccessOrFailure to Success.
 - Added "instant" flag to components. Components marked instant will affect sequences and selectors when moving between child nodes. When a child node marked "instant" completes, rather than waiting for the next tree tick to tick the following child node, the sequence or selector does it immediately.
 - The compiler progress bar returns.
 - Editing a Behave asset now focuses the asset browser last instead of the tree editor.
 - Behave can now be installed in any subfolder of Assets - provided its internal folder structure remains intact.
 - Compilation speed improvements.
 - Enabled references across collection borders.
 - Added Tree.DataSize - returning the number of bytes used by a tree instance. This is also displayed in the debugger window.

1.3:
 - Fixed priority selector init flag resetting.
 - Fixed reference handling on tree renaming and deletion.
 - Fixed references still pointing at old collection post collection duplication.
 - Fixed compilation of actions and decorators with non-integral float parameters.
 - Fixed GUI list behaviours.
 - Fixed passing context back and forth between referenced trees and referrer.
 - Fixed reordering connections not causing save state to be set.
 - Various GUI tweaks.
 - Runtime optimisations.
 - Enabled scrolling of the tree list in the debugger window.
 - Exposed Tree.ReflectForwards.
 - Added Tree.ResetForwards.
 - Added agent blueprints - connecting to agent handlers through virtual methods rather than reflected handlers.
 - Made connections selectable in the tree editor via the connection nub.
 - Moved connection managing from the inspector to the tree editor, where it is more visible and handy.
 - Added support for disabling connections - for faster, less destructive debugging.
 - Double-click reference component to jump to referenced tree.
 - Changed "Cannot update unregistered tree" handling from an exception to an error message. Still need more info.
 - Now showing string and float parameters in the tree editor if either is set.

1.2:
 - Fixed release building.
 - Added the priority selector, introducing the API points:
    - int IAgent.SelectTopPriority (Tree sender, params int[] IDs);
    - enum BL[LibraryName].PriorityType { PriorityName, ..., Unknown };
 - Added support for branch contexts, introducing the API points:
    - enum BL[LibraryName].ContextType { ContextName, ..., Unknown };
    - int Tree.ActiveContext { get; }
 - Changed IAgent interface:
    - Tick (bool init, Tree sender) -&gt; Tick (Tree sender, bool init)
 - Added "Select asset" button to the standard inspector.
 - Interface polish.

1.1:
 - Made compatible with Unity 3.0 - including ensuring that the 2.5-2.6.1 bug preventing compilation on Windows is fixed on the Unity side.
 - UI tweaks and polish.
 - Added the option to have return values of nodes be inverted.
 - Fixed compiler bug when facing sequence or selector with only one child node.
 - Renamed Library.Tree -&gt; Library.InstantiateTree.
 - Added Tree.Tick () and Tree.Reset () methods using the IAgent instance given at instantiation of the tree.
 - Removed the abstract Library class.
 - Changed generated library class:
    - Trees -&gt; TreeType.
    - Actions -&gt; ActionType.
    - Decorators -&gt; DecoratorType.
    - Tree InstantiateTree (int, IAgent) -&gt; static Tree InstantiateTree (TreeType, IAgent)
    - int TreeID (Tree) -&gt; static TreeType Type (Tree)
    - bool IsAction (int) -&gt; static bool IsAction (int)
    - bool IsDecorator (int) -&gt; static bool IsDecorator (int)
 - Upped editor performance.
 - New asset structure change with automatic import of Behave 1.0 assets.
 - Changed action and decorator handlers. These are now the handlers mapped:
    - public BehaveResult Init[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
    - public BehaveResult Tick[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
    - public void Reset[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
    - public BehaveResult Init[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender);
    - public BehaveResult Tick[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender);
    - public void Reset[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender);
    - public BehaveResult [Name][Action/Decorator] {get; set;}
 - Added support for collection duplication.
 - Moved debug rendering into the editor with its own dedicated debugger window, including actor listing.
 - Debugger now renders active sub-trees as well.

1.0:
 - Lots o fixes for Unity 2.5 compatibility.
 - Closer editor integration with new UI.
    - Component bar.
    - Node inspection.
 - Runtime tree debugging.
 - Direct mapping of action and delegate handlers via reflection.
 - Kitty demo.

0.3b:
 - Various tweaks to the editor UI.
 - Optimised the compiler.
 - Fixed the following editor bugs from the bug list:
    - When the editor scrips are recompiled and when the user enters and exits play mode, running editors will loose references, causing undetermined behaviour.
    - When a compile fails, the Behave compiler is locked and unusable – requiring a unity relaunch.
 - Implemented the following wishlist items:
    - Behaviour tree decorators.
    - Stand-alone edition of the Behave editor.
    - Behaviour tree debugging features.

0.2b:
 - Made the demo project a whole lot more interesting.
 - Implemented the editor wish list item: Ability to move trees between collections.
 - Various tweaks to the editor UI.
 - Fixed a ton of bugs in the compiler.
 - Fixed the following editor bugs from the bug list:
    - Not able to delete collections from library.
    - Not able to delete trees from library.
    - Not able to rename collections from library.
    - Not able to rename trees from library.
    - Missing "tree has been changed, save changes?" dialog.

0.1b:
 - Some documentation is available.
 - Compiler is now creating sensible output.
 - A simple test tree and script using it is provided with the demo.
 - Documentation is linked directly from the unity help menu.
