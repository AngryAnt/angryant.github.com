				<div id="content">
					<div class="post"><p>In 2010 the Unity Asset Store launched with an editor extension already live. That extension was Behave 1. Three years later, after way too long a pause, I have finally gotten around to releasing version 2.0 of Behave.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, especially lately, I have had quite a few things going on &#8211; not the least of which is my recent exit from Unity Technologies and entry into freelancing. This all meant not a lot of time for Behave.</p>
<p>So anyway, this is what I was doing when I was not writing that Unity Hacks blog post you were waiting for.</p>
<h2>Behave</h2>
<p>If you have no idea what Behave is and don&#8217;t feel like dropping by the <a href="/behave">subsection on this site</a> dedicated to it, here is how it is defined on the Asset Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behave is a system for designing, integrating and running behaviour logic using Behaviour Trees. At its core Behave has a drag-drop designer and a highly effective and flexible compiled runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No funky runtime data formats or interpretation. Designer &#8594; Compiler &#8594; Your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the use of a workflow extension without proper rapid iteration tools? Connect the visual debugger with break, step, reset, breakpoints and overrides directly to your project in the editor or on your target device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: An introductory video to Behave 2 is now available:</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vcsFjM-cw9k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Part of the challenge with any project is always to fight feature creep. This was very much also the case with Behave 2, so don&#8217;t worry &#8211; I have plenty of improvements to come. Not saying that this build is broken though &#8211; go get it!</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>Unlike Behave 1, version 2 is a paid package. Aside from having gone freelance and needing a financial basis to keep up support for the software, this also had to be done as the Asset Store long ago banned the use of custom licenses.</p>
<p>This, of-course posed a bit of a problem for Behave 1&#8217;s default &#8220;free if you show the splash&#8221; license. Fortunately the Asset Store team members are merciful gods and I got a veeery long grace period to beat Behave into compliance.</p>
<p>Included in the license is also access to a private community and internal support resources &#8211; including the beta list.</p>
<h2>Launch</h2>
<p>For a limited time after launch, Behave 2 will be available at a flat discount of 50%. Additionally, if you happen to bump into me at Unite 2013 in Vancouver next week, you can slip me your business card and partake in the draw for one of <strong>three free Behave 2 licenses</strong>.</p>
<p>If you already purchased a copy of Behave 2 and win a free copy, I&#8217;ll refund you the purchase amount.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Details of the Unite license draw are available <a href="/unite2013">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>So if you are a Behave 1 user and you are wondering what exactly is under the hood, I included the full Behave changelog below.</p>
<p>Now you might go &#8220;1.5? What the hell? Did I miss something?&#8221;. No you did not. That version unfortunately did not ship, but was in stead rolled straight into 2.0. But hey, water and bridges, right? 2.0 is here baby!</p>
<p><a href="http://u3d.as/5hA">Behave 2 for Unity on the asset store</a>.</p>
<pre>Changelist:

2.0:
 - New editor.
	- Unified all controls into one window.
	- Completely customised look - compatible with both Unity light and dark skin.
	- Keyboard authoring interface in addition to drag &amp; drop.
 - Debugger upgrade.
	- Remote debugging.
	- Tick and reset.
	- "Unplug" for debugger-only control.
	- Breakpoints.
	- Action overrides - override the return values of specified actions.
 - Decorator rewrite.
	- Deprecated old decorator.
	   - Still compiles, but cannot be added.
	- Decorators are now control-type components.
	   - No specific decorator handlers on agents.
	   - Control is achieved via third connection socket.
	- Two initial decorator types: Repeater and Interrupter.
 - Asset restructuring.
	- No more collections - for nesting, use paths in tree names.
	- New serialization format - see Readme.txt for upgrade instructions.
	- Collections are gone. Use Unix-style path names for tree organisation.
 - IAgent.Tick (Tree, bool) changed to IAgent.Tick (Tree)
	- Init calls can now only be handled explicitly
 - Full coverage online documentation and other community resources.
 - Countless fixes and polish items.

1.5:
 - Added Tree.TickActive - indicating if a tree is currently executing a tick or if it has completed evaluation.
 - In-tick tree reset requests now result in a reset at the end of tree evaluation rather than an immediate one.
 - Removed the legacy compatibility assembly (for compatibility with pre-1.2 assets) from the default distribution.
 - Fixed "X must be instantiated using the ScriptableObject.CreateInstance method instead of new X" warnings.

1.4:
 - Fixed decorator incorrectly initializing on every returning tick when tick handler returned Running.
 - Fixed debugger view dependency on active tree editor - causing reported null reference exception.
 - Fixed missing scrollbars on browser window.
 - Reduced logging noise from debug builds.
 - Agent blueprints can now be MonoBehaviour based.
 - Clarified wording on "library not loaded".
 - Now handling reset a bit cleverer - potential performance boost.
 - Changed the default success criteria of Parallel components from SuccessOrFailure to Success.
 - Added "instant" flag to components. Components marked instant will affect sequences and selectors when moving between child nodes. When a child node marked "instant" completes, rather than waiting for the next tree tick to tick the following child node, the sequence or selector does it immediately.
 - The compiler progress bar returns.
 - Editing a Behave asset now focuses the asset browser last instead of the tree editor.
 - Behave can now be installed in any subfolder of Assets - provided its internal folder structure remains intact.
 - Compilation speed improvements.
 - Enabled references across collection borders.
 - Added Tree.DataSize - returning the number of bytes used by a tree instance. This is also displayed in the debugger window.

1.3:
 - Fixed priority selector init flag resetting.
 - Fixed reference handling on tree renaming and deletion.
 - Fixed references still pointing at old collection post collection duplication.
 - Fixed compilation of actions and decorators with non-integral float parameters.
 - Fixed GUI list behaviours.
 - Fixed passing context back and forth between referenced trees and referrer.
 - Fixed reordering connections not causing save state to be set.
 - Various GUI tweaks.
 - Runtime optimisations.
 - Enabled scrolling of the tree list in the debugger window.
 - Exposed Tree.ReflectForwards.
 - Added Tree.ResetForwards.
 - Added agent blueprints - connecting to agent handlers through virtual methods rather than reflected handlers.
 - Made connections selectable in the tree editor via the connection nub.
 - Moved connection managing from the inspector to the tree editor, where it is more visible and handy.
 - Added support for disabling connections - for faster, less destructive debugging.
 - Double-click reference component to jump to referenced tree.
 - Changed "Cannot update unregistered tree" handling from an exception to an error message. Still need more info.
 - Now showing string and float parameters in the tree editor if either is set.

1.2:
 - Fixed release building.
 - Added the priority selector, introducing the API points:
	- int IAgent.SelectTopPriority (Tree sender, params int[] IDs);
	- enum BL[LibraryName].PriorityType { PriorityName, ..., Unknown };
 - Added support for branch contexts, introducing the API points:
	- enum BL[LibraryName].ContextType { ContextName, ..., Unknown };
	- int Tree.ActiveContext { get; }
 - Changed IAgent interface:
	- Tick (bool init, Tree sender) -&gt; Tick (Tree sender, bool init)
 - Added "Select asset" button to the standard inspector.
 - Interface polish.

1.1:
 - Made compatible with Unity 3.0 - including ensuring that the 2.5-2.6.1 bug preventing compilation on Windows is fixed on the Unity side.
 - UI tweaks and polish.
 - Added the option to have return values of nodes be inverted.
 - Fixed compiler bug when facing sequence or selector with only one child node.
 - Renamed Library.Tree -&gt; Library.InstantiateTree.
 - Added Tree.Tick () and Tree.Reset () methods using the IAgent instance given at instantiation of the tree.
 - Removed the abstract Library class.
 - Changed generated library class:
	- Trees -&gt; TreeType.
	- Actions -&gt; ActionType.
	- Decorators -&gt; DecoratorType.
	- Tree InstantiateTree (int, IAgent) -&gt; static Tree InstantiateTree (TreeType, IAgent)
	- int TreeID (Tree) -&gt; static TreeType Type (Tree)
	- bool IsAction (int) -&gt; static bool IsAction (int)
	- bool IsDecorator (int) -&gt; static bool IsDecorator (int)
 - Upped editor performance.
 - New asset structure change with automatic import of Behave 1.0 assets.
 - Changed action and decorator handlers. These are now the handlers mapped:
	- public BehaveResult Init[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
	- public BehaveResult Tick[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
	- public void Reset[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender, string stringParameter, float floatParameter, IAgent agent, object data);
	- public BehaveResult Init[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender);
	- public BehaveResult Tick[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender);
	- public void Reset[Name][Action/Decorator] (Tree sender);
	- public BehaveResult [Name][Action/Decorator] {get; set;}

 - Optimised the compiler.
 - Fixed the following editor bugs from the bug list:
	- When the editor scrips are recompiled and when the user enters and exits play mode, running editors will loose references, causing undetermined behaviour.
	- When a compile fails, the Behave compiler is locked and unusable – requiring a unity relaunch.
 - Implemented the following wishlist items:
	- Behaviour tree decorators.
	- Stand-alone edition of the Behave editor.
	- Behaviour tree debugging features.

0.2b:
 - Made the demo project a whole lot more interesting.
 - Implemented the editor wish list item: Ability to move trees between collections.
 - Various tweaks to the editor UI.
 - Fixed a ton of bugs in the compiler.
 - Fixed the following editor bugs from the bug list:
	- Not able to delete collections from library.
	- Not able to delete trees from library.
	- Not able to rename collections from library.
	- Not able to rename trees from library.
	- Missing "tree has been changed, save changes?" dialog.

0.1b:
 - Some documentation is available.
 - Compiler is now creating sensible output.
 - A simple test tree and script using it is provided with the demo.
 - Documentation is linked directly from the unity help menu.
 - Less spamming of the log with debug information.

Pre-release:
